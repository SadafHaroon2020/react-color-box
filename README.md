# react-color-box
Objective

Create a <div> box with an onClick handle event that changes the background color when clicked. 
When the box is clicked, we want a clickCounter indicating how many times it was clicked. 
We want the box color to toggle back to it's original color! (Hint: create a toggle function)

Before reaching step 3, make sure to create a GitHub repository called `React Box Color`  and add/commit what you currently have. 
 

Do you accept a challenge?

Randomize the color that will appear for every box click and make sure the clickCounter is incrementing properly!
